## Weight and Biases logging

To use W&B logging in this project create a file named `credentials_wandb.yml` in the `conf/local` directory. It should have one attribute called `api_key` that stores an API Key to your W&B account.

Once you have set up the credentials_wandb.yml file, you can run the project and enjoy the benefits of W&B logging. The project will automatically log relevant experiment metrics and provide visualizations through the W&B platform.
